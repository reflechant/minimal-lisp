# miniLISP

A barebone LISP interpeter described in Paul Graham's paper ["The
Roots of LISP"](https://paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html) implemented
in Go.

It's not intended to be practically usable, only to demonstrate the
"Maxwell equations" nature of LISP by implementing the Eval function
in itself using 7 axiomatic operators.

Just run main.go and read the article and the code to understand.
