// Package core implements the core LISP interpreter

// You may find the article here: https://paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html.
// It's not intended to be practically usable
// only to showcase the points made in the paper
// and demonstrate the "Maxwell equations" nature of LISP
// by implementing the Eval function in itself
// using 7 axiomatic operators
// and a little bit of other functionality (like function invocation).
// The eval.lisp file is a copy from https://paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html.

// but they are still useless since you can't have a slice of them)

// and one symbol can only be either a function or a value.
// Shadowing is allowed and you can rebind a function symbol to a value and vice versa.
